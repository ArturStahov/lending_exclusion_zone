                    The game about Chernobyl exclusion zone 30 years after the Chernobyl accident.
                      Zombie apocalypse started here!
                      Due to the disaster that occurred on the territory of the former URSR in 1986 at the Chernobyl
                    nuclear
                    power plant, a
                    huge part of the territory was evacuated by creating the so-called Exclusion Zone.
                      After 30 years, due to the action of increased radiation, unexplained facts began to occur in the
                    form
                    of mutations of
                    living flesh. In the zone, experiments and studies on the development of mutagens began, but at one
                    point
                    it became
                    impossible to control the mutation.
                      Under your control, the post, the former laboratory, is equipped with a workshop, a warehouse, a
                    generator and even
                    transport.
                      Your main goal is to prevent a crowd of zombie mutants from breaking into your shelter. To do
                    this, you
                    need to
                    provide the post with provisions making forays into the zone.
                    Survive at any cost!!!
                      The main resource for survival - ammunition, they also became the main currency in the new world.
                    You
                    will also need a
                    lot of effort to extract clean water and fuel for your generator and transport. For the good, you
                    have a
                    workshop where
                    it is possible, in the presence of various kinds of components, to make this or that resource.
                      You need the resources to upgrade your defenses, vehicles, weapons.
                      Develop your post “Shelter”, not quick, it will not be easy to do this - but such is the price to
                    survive.
                      Develop your character by increasing his level and characteristics. You can choose one of the
                    specializations.
