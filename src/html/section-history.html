                    This game is about the Chernobyl exclusion zone after 30 years of the Chernobyl accident. The zombie
                    apocalypse has
                    begun here! As a result of the disaster that occurred on the territory of the former URSR in 1986 at
                    the Chernobyl
                    nuclear power plant, a huge part of the territory was evacuated by creating the so-called exclusion
                    zone. After 30
                    years, due to the action of increased radiation, unexplained facts began to happen in the form of
                    mutations in living
                    flesh. Experiments and research on the development of mutagens began in the zone, but at some point,
                    it became
                    impossible to control the mutation. You must control the post. This is an old laboratory that has a
                    workshop, warehouse,
                    generator and even transport. Your main goal is to prevent a crowd of mutant zombies from entering
                    your shelter. You
                    need to supply the post with provisions by raiding the zone. You must to survive at any cost!!! The
                    main resource for
                    survival is ammunition, it also became the main currency in the new world. It will also take a lot
                    of effort to find
                    clean water and petrol for your generator and vehicle. Actually, you have a workshop where you can
                    make the required
                    resource if you have all sorts of components. You need resources to improve your defenses, vehicles,
                    weapons. Develop
                    your post "Shelter", not fast, it won't be easy - but such is the price of survival. Develop your
                    character by
                    increasing his level and characteristics. You can choose one of the specializations.
